TestBed .

The TestBed creates a dynamically-constructed Angular test module that emulates an Angular @NgModule. All the modules, componenets and services and other dependecis will go in here .

As it is being construceted dynamically we need an async approach .

beforeEach
Most test suites in this guide call beforeEach() to set the preconditions for each it() test and rely on the TestBed to create classes and inject services.

There's another school of testing that never calls beforeEach() and and prefers to create classes explicitly rather than use the TestBed.



types





1. create a login component. 

Add input field and button .

go to sevice to get the auth data using username and password .




/**                                             **/                
**************** Passport JS  - ****************
**/                                             **/
Passport is easily configured into any Express application just like we conigure other Express middlewere like body-parser,session-checker. 

Authenticate the routes .



The second parameter is the type of strategy that you want to create, here we use the username-password or the LocalStrategy.
 The passReqToCallback config variable allows us to access the request object in the callback,
  thereby enabling us to use any parameter associated with the request.
